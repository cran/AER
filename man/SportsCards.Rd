\details{
\code{SportsCards} contains data from 148 randomly selected traders who attended
a trading card show in Orlando, Florida, in 1998. Traders were randomly given one
of two sports collectables, say good A or good B, that had approximately equal market
value. Those receiving good A were then given the option of trading good A for good B
with the experimenter; those receiving good B were given the option of trading good B
for good A with the experimenter. Good A was a ticket stub from the game that Cal Ripken Jr.
set the record for consecutive games played, and Good B was a souvenir
from the game that Nolan Ryan won his 300th game.
