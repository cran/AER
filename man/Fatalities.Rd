\details{
Traffic fatalities are from the US Department of 
Transportation Fatal Accident Reporting System.  The beer tax is the 
tax on a case of beer, which is an available measure of state 
alcohol taxes more generally. The drinking age variable is a factor 
indicating whether the legal drinking age is 18, 19, or 20.  
The two binary punishment variables  describe the state's minimum 
sentencing requirements for an initial drunk driving conviction. 

Total vehicle miles traveled annually by state was obtained from 
the Department of Transportation. Personal income was obtained 
from the US Bureau of Economic Analysis, and the unemployment 
rate was obtained from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics.
