\details{
Project STAR (Student/Teacher Achievement Ratio) was a four-year
longitudinal class-size study funded by the Tennessee General Assembly
and conducted in the late 1980s by the State Department of Education. Over 7,000 students
in 79 schools were randomly assigned into one of three interventions:
small class (13 to 17 students per teacher), regular class (22 to 25
students per teacher), and regular-with-aide class (22 to 25 students
with a full-time teacher's aide).  Classroom teachers were also randomly
assigned to the classes they would teach. The interventions were
initiated as the students entered school in kindergarten and continued
through third grade.

The Project STAR public access data set contains data on test scores,
treatment groups, and student and teacher characteristics for
the four years of the experiment, from academic year 1985--1986 to
academic year 1988--1989. The test score data analyzed in this
chapter are the sum of the scores on the math and reading portion of the
Stanford Achievement Test. 

Stock and Watson (2007) obtained the data set from the
Project STAR Web site.

The data is provided in wide format. Reshaping it into long format
is illustrated below. Note that the levels of the \code{degree}, \code{ladder}
and \code{tethnicity} variables differ slightly between kindergarten
and higher grades.

\examples{
data("STAR")

## Stock and Watson, p. 488
fmk <- lm(I(readk + mathk) ~ stark, data = STAR)
fm1 <- lm(I(read1 + math1) ~ star1, data = STAR)
fm2 <- lm(I(read2 + math2) ~ star2, data = STAR)

## Stock and Watson, p. 489
fmke <- lm(I(readk + mathk) ~ stark + experiencek, data = STAR)
coeftest(fmke, vcov = sandwich)

## reshape data from wide into long format
## 1. variables and their levels
nam <- c("star", "read", "math", "lunch", "school", "degree", "ladder",
  "experience", "tethnicity", "system", "schoolid")
lev <- c("k", "1", "2", "3")
## 2. reshaping
star <- reshape(STAR, idvar = "id", ids = row.names(STAR),
  times = lev, timevar = "grade", direction = "long",
  varying = lapply(nam, function(x) paste(x, lev, sep = "")))
## 3. improve variable names and type
names(star)[5:15] <- nam
star$id <- factor(star$id)
star$grade <- factor(star$grade, levels = lev, labels = c("kindergarten", "1st", "2nd", "3rd"))
rm(nam, lev)

## fit a single model nested in grade (equivalent to fmk, fm1, fm2, fmk)
fm <- lm(I(read + math) ~ 0 + grade/star, data = star)
coeftest(fm, vcov = sandwich)

## visualization
library("lattice")
bwplot(I(read + math) ~ star | grade, data = star)
