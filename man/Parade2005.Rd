\title{Parade Magazine 2005 Earnings Data}
\description{
US earnings data, as provided in an annual survey of Parade (here from 2005), the
Sunday newspaper magazine supplementing the Sunday (or Weekend) edition of many
daily newspapers in the USA. 
}
\usage{data("Parade2005")}

\format{
A data frame containing 130 observations on 5 variables.
\describe{
\item{earnings}{Annual personal earnings.}
\item{age}{Age in years.}
\item{gender}{Factor indicating gender.}
\item{state}{Factor indicating state.}
\item{celebrity}{Factor. Is the individual a celebrity?}
}
}

\details{
In addition to the four variables provided by Parade (earnings, age, gender, and state),
a fifth variable was introduced, the \dQuote{celebrity factor} (here actors, athletes, 
TV personalities, politicians, and CEOs are considered celebrities). The data are quite 
far from a simple random sample, there being substantial oversampling of celebrities.
