\title{More Guns, Less Crime?}

\description{
Guns is a balanced panel of data on 50 US states, plus the District of Columbia (for a
total of 51 states), by year for 1977--1999.
}

\usage{data("Guns")}

\format{
A data frame containing 1,173 observations on 13 variables.
\describe{
  \item{state}{factor indicating state.}
  \item{year}{factor indicating year.}
  \item{violent}{violent crime rate (incidents per 100,000 members of the population).}
  \item{murder}{murder rate (incidents per 100,000).}
  \item{robbery}{robbery rate (incidents per 100,000).}
  \item{prisoners}{incarceration rate in the state in the previous year
    (sentenced prisoners per 100,000 residents; value for the previous year).}
  \item{afam}{percent of state population that is African-American, ages 10 to 64.}
  \item{cauc}{percent of state population that is Caucasian, ages 10 to 64.}
  \item{male}{percent of state population that is male, ages 10 to 29.}
  \item{population}{state population, in millions of people.}
  \item{income}{real per capita personal income in the state (US dollars).}
  \item{density}{population per square mile of land area, divided by 1,000.}
  \item{law}{factor. Does the state have a shall carry law in effect in that year?}
}
}

\details{
Each observation is a given state in a given year. 
There are a total of 51 states times 23 years = 1,173 observations.
